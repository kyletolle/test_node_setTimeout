# test_node_setTimeout

This project allows me to test out how setTimeout works in express. Specifically the differences between server.setTimeout, request.setTimeout, and response.setTimeout.

# Installing

```
npm install
```

# Running

```
npm run start
```

# Throttling uploads

Use Charles proxy and ngrok (installed in some folder you've shelled into), then run
```
./ngrok http 8180
```

Then you can access the URL that ngrok generates for you.
